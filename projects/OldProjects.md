### Game Description
One of my earlier projects. An almost one to one clone of the original _Pac-Man_. Researched how the AI behaved in the original arcade game and mimicked it closely. Developed a resource management system with handles to resources that prevented multiple instances of a resource from being loaded. Every object in the game belonged to an Entity hierarchy that contained base properties and Update/Render overrideable functions. Separated render and update loops from being locked to each other, ensuring that the game updated at a constant frame-rate and rendering would happen as fast as possible.


## Source Engine Modding

### Level Designer/Programmer (Source Engine - Hammer Editor - C++)
(2006 to 2010)

### Game Description
Developed numerous maps with a focus on building level geometry, setting atmospheric tone with lighting and effects, and creating scripted level events. Made minor code modifications to weapon, character and game mode classes. Worked collaboratively with other modders in the Interlopers community.
