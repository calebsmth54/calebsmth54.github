## Pac-Man Clone
## (2006)
### Game Programmer (SDL - C++)

An almost one to one clone of the original _Pac-Man_. Researched how the AI behaved in the original arcade game and replicated it closely.

## Source Engine Modding
## (2004 to 2010)
### Level Designer/Programmer (Source Engine - Hammer Editor - C++)

Developed numerous maps with a focus on building level geometry, setting atmospheric tone with lighting and effects, and creating scripted level events. Made minor code modifications to weapon, character and game mode classes. Worked collaboratively with other modders in the Interlopers mapping community.
