## Pac-Man Clone
## (2006)
### Game Programmer (SDL - C++)

One of my earlier projects. An almost one to one clone of the original _Pac-Man_. Researched how the AI behaved in the original arcade game and mimicked it closely. Developed a resource management system with handles to resources that prevented multiple instances of a resource from being loaded. Every object in the game belonged to an Entity hierarchy that contained base properties and Update/Render overrideable functions. Separated render and update loops from being locked to each other, ensuring that the game updated at a constant frame-rate and rendering would happen as fast as possible.

### Level Designer/Programmer (Source Engine - Hammer Editor - C++)
(2004 to 2010)

### Game Description
