## Game Description
A project me and a group of others developed for Ludum Dare /#39 with the theme "Running out of Power". Rather than taking this prompt literally and developing a game about battery power, our team collectively decided on a hero who would continually lose abilities over the course of the game. The combat was inspired by _Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery_ with a simple click the ability interface and timing based combat. AI runs on a simple interval based action state, with random rolling for Idle or Attack States. Players can attack, block, heal and quake (do massive damage) to enemies, but as mentioned above, they lose each of these abilities over the course of the game until they are left defenseless against their final foe.

Besides combat, the game is mostly focused on narrative and ambience. I can't give enough credit to my team for nailing the level design, art and audio for the project. I contributed to this aspect of the game by hooking up all these assets, timing the narration with various triggers in the game and making some minor modifications to the level in order to support the narrative.

Overall this was an incredibly experience and I am very proud that we were able to achieve where others traditionally fail and create a complete, narrative based experience with a unique combat system in only 72 hours.
