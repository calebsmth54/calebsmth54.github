### Battle System

[![Event Graph](/img/LD/BP_BattleSystem0_EventGraph_Preview.PNG)](/img/LD/BP_BattleSystem0_EventGraph.PNG){:target="_blank"}

The battle system is easily the most complex script I wrote for the project. It handles numerous tasks, including setting up the visuals for the battle area (lighting, background, enemy and player), resolving player/enemy actions, and offering notifications for other scripts to poll the state of the battle. Inspired by the combat in _Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery_, combat happens in real time. To resolve a block, the combat system checks whether the swing happened during the blocks active window. See the Action Component section below.

### Player Blueprint

[![Event Graph](/img/LD/Player/BP_Player1_Preview.PNG)](/img/LD/Player/BP_Player1.PNG){:target="_blank"}

You will notice that the character has several components (Attack, Block, Heal, Quake). This are inherited from the Action Component script. More on that below.

### UI Blueprints

[![Event Graph](/img/LD/Player/HUD1_Preview.PNG)](/img/LD/Player/HUD1.PNG){:target="_blank"}

This is where the meat of the player's interaction with the game takes place. The UI informs the player of their health, the enemy's health and their available actions. These buttons are updated with cooldown info after the player has used an associated action. Over the course of the game, some of the buttons are disabled as the player character loses strength.

### Action Component Blueprint

This class drives both player and enemy actions. It provides a simple data driven interface to tweak the length, active window and other such timing properties of an action. Using this component I was able to easily hookup player and enemy actions and their associated effects without copying a lot of code over and over. This little component turned out to be a life saver on the project, and the small amount of investment time I put into creating it paid off well.

### Level Editing and Scripting

By the end of the project we had a level filled with static props and other environment art with a general idea of the pathway the player would take through the world. I came in and placed all of the enemy encounters, defined the player level boundaries, scripted all of the narration and music triggers, and tweaked the level's geometry to extend gameplay for narration length and cue the player to environmental details.
