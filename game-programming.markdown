### Gameplay Development
From rapid prototyping to full production of systems like AI, UI, weapons, characters and game rules, I can turn any design into a functional feature quickly. 

### Clean & Future Proof
My goal is to develop clean, "sane" code fully integrated with the game editor. This gives you maximum flexibility to tweak and/or extend my code easily to meet any new requirements throughout production.

### Working with Existing Code
Give me your code and I'll quickly diagnose and squash bugs, refactor the code for readability and performance, and extend its functionality.
