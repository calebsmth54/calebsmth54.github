Hello there stranger.

Ten years ago my passion for video games progressed from casual observer to actively learning about game development. In this time span I taught myself C++, participated in the Source Engine mod community, developed my own games using frameworks like SDL and Phaser, to now where I am the lead programmer on an independent UE4 game. I have come a long way from where I started, but my drive for improving as a developer hasn't died down.

Thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio. Please feel free to contact me. I am always interested in talking shop with fellow developers.

Sincerely,

Caleb Smith.
