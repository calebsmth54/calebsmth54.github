Hello there stranger,

Ten years ago my passion for video games progressed from casual observer to actively learning about game development. In this time span I taught myself C++, participated in the Source Engine mod community, developed my own games using frameworks like SDL and Phaser, to now where I work primarily with the Unreal and Unity engines. I have come a long way from where I started, but my passion for continually improving my self as a developer hasn't lessened.

Thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio. Please feel free to contact me.

Have a good one!,

Caleb Smith.
