Hello, and thank you for stopping by.

My many years of developing mods and smaller games has given me a strong background in development and my education in film has given me a unique perspective from which to tackle design problems.

Currently I am seeking Entry-level Gameplay Programming positions at AAA game development studios. I am confident that I could make a strong, long term addition to your team, but I am also eager to continue learning and further develop my skills by working with the best.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in discussing my qualifications further.
