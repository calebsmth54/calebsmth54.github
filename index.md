Hello there stranger.

Ten years ago my passion for virtual worlds as a casual observer progressed from tinkering with console commands to wanting to pursue a career as a game developer. In this time span I taught myself C++, participated in the Source Engine modding community, developed my own games using frameworks like SDL and Phaser, to now where I am the lead programmer on an independent UE4 game. I have come a long way from where I started, but my drive for learning more hasn't lessened.

That is why I am currently seeking entry-level game programming employment at a AAA studio. I thrive in an environment surrounded by talented and creative people. Working with others pushes me to always top the quality of my work and I really enjoy helping out my colleagues with technical advice or feedback. If given the opportunity, I know that I can leverage my existing knowledge of game engine architecture and game design to hit the ground running and become a valuable long term hire.

Thank you for stopping by to check out my portfolio. Please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss my qualifications further, or if you just want to chat and give me feedback on my work. I am always interested in talking shop with fellow developers.

Sincerely,
Caleb Smith.
