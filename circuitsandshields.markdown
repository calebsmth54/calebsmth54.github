description: Worked closely with lead to balance existing characters and help push feature creation for an initial alpha release.
---

### Design
Pushed and help develop highest priority features needed for alpha release. Worked closely with programmer to ensure these featuers worked as expected and to share observed bugs. Rewrote ability descriptions to be more brief and reflect actual game values. 

### Game Balancing
Developed Sheet documents projecting character XP growth, player gold gain, general stat growth, and game mode specific modifiers to sync up with desired time limit of ARAM-esque mode.

### Editor Work
Input all stat changes from documentation in-editor and verified that their values reflected what was in the design. Added bounding boxes, setup actors and optimized level for game mode.
