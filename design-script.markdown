### Feature Design
Bringing experience as a passionate player and student of game design, I can provide design documentation, idea pitches and prototypes to sell or communicate your vision.

### Level Creation & Scripting
I can provide initial design layouts, level block-outs, scripted sequences and events, and finalized "beautified" levels ready for shipping.

### Game Balancing
Game balancing isn't just about moving sliders up and down. Using Sheets or Excel, I can provide graphs, tables and other means to make balancing an informed decision rather than a shot in the dark.
