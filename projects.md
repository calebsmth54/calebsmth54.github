Site: [Lead N Brimstone](http://www.wadenkanestudios.com/#!projects/leadnbrimestone.html)

### Game Description
A fast paced, 2D side scrolling shooter inspired by _Contra_, _Ghost 'n Goblins_ and _Doom_. Players take control of a knight fighting off endless waves of increasingly difficult demonic creatures. For this project we want to capture the magic of classic arcade and NES games: Easy to learn, difficult to master. We plan on having a gameplay loop that is brutally difficult, but never punishes the player with arbitrary failure states and instead empowers them to master their skills in order to beat that next foe.

*Weapon System:*

- Designed, implemented and coded a weapon system that could support various weapon types (Trace, Projectile and Melee).
- Used by both enemies and players for unique attacks.
- Easily extended by designers in the Blueprints scripting system.

*Characters:*

- Developed a base character class that could support our wide range of character types.
- Implemented animation state machines for characters.

*AI:*

- Developed base AI functions that would lay the ground work for every enemy behavior in game.
- Utilized Unreal's Behavior Tree System so that large variation of AI behaviors could be created easily and tested immediately in the editor.

*Project Management:*

- Setup and continue to manage Perforce repository and assisted team with use of version control.
- Helped team members make transition from Unity development to Unreal development.
- Took on responsibility of implementing all of the major gameplay features after Lead Programmer left project.
- Assisted with design of the game as well as work with designers on exposing core C++ features to Blueprint Scripting System.
- Regularly refactor code in order to achieve readability and ease of use.

## Horror Turn Based Game (C++/Blueprint Scripting/Unreal Editor) Early WIP

### A side project put on hold to focus on Lead N Brimstone

### Game Description
A unique take on the horror movie genre inspired by the film _Cabin in the Woods_ and the tabletop game _Betrayal on Haunted House Hill_, that combines horror and turn based strategy concepts. Players take control of evil, the hidden force pulling the strings in every horror movie that makes every creak, slams every door shut and draws its victims to their grisly ends. Development put on hold to focus on Lead N Brimstone.

- *Concept:* Players have two objectives, draw the survivors in to release the monster from its dormant state and then take control of the monster in order to finish off the survivors. The game will feature several scenarios based on a familiar horror movie theme and an endless variety of randomly rolled variables, such as victim archetypes and traits, monster traits and weaknesses, and scenario objectives.

- *Developed Code:* Extended Unreal's top-down camera system and developed selectable base character type.

## Prior Experience (pre-2015)

*Phaser Development (Javascript/Phaser/HTML5):* Two simple projects I developed in order to learn JavaScript and learn about mobile game development.

[Touch Example](/phaser-games/PixiGame/pixigame.html)

[Brick Breaker](/phaser-games/BrickBreaker/brickbreaker.html)

*Classic Game Clones (C++/SDL/Engine Development):* Developed game clones of _Pong_, _Tetris_ and _Pac-Man_ which established my strong programming fundamentals and understanding of how game engines work on a base level.

*Source Engine Modding (C++/Level Design & Scripting/Hammer Editor):* Developed numerous maps focusing on geometry building, atmosphere setting and entity scripting. Made minor code modifications to weapon, character and game mode classes. Received constructive criticism from and gave to my peers.
