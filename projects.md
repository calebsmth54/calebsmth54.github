Site: [Lead N Brimstone](http://www.wadenkanestudios.com/#!projects/leadnbrimestone.html)


### Game Description
A fast paced, 2D side scrolling shooter inspired by _Contra_, _Ghost and Goblins_ and _Doom_. Players take control of a knight fighting off endless waves of increasingly difficult demonic creatures. For this project we want to capture the magic of classic arcade and NES games: Easy to learn, difficult to master. We plan on having a gameplay loop that is brutally difficult, but never punishes with arbitrary failure states and empowers them to master their skills in order to beat that next foe.

- *Weapon System:* Designed, implemented and coded a weapon system that could support various weapon types (Trace, Projectile and Melee), be used by both enemies and players for unique attacks, and be easily extended by designers in the Blueprints scripting system.

- *Characters:* Developed a base character class that could support our wide range of character types and implemented animation state machines for characters.

- *AI:* Developed base AI functions that would lay the ground work for every behavior of enemies in game. Utilized Unreal's Behavior Tree System so that an infinite number of AI behaviors could be created easily and tested immediately in the editor.

- *Project Management:* Setup and continually managed Perforce repository and assisted team with use of version control. Helped team members make transition from Unity development to Unreal development. Took on responsibility of implementing all of the major gameplay features after Lead Programmer left project. Assisted with design of the game as well as work with designers on exposing core C++ features to Blueprint Scripting System. Regularly refactor code in order to achieve readability and optimization.

## Haunted House Turn Based Game (C++/Blueprint Scripting/Unreal Editor) Early WIP

### A side project put on hold to focus on Lead N Brimstone

### Game Description
A unique take on the horror movie genre inspired by the film _Cabin in the Woods_ and the tabletop game _Betrayal on Haunted House Hill_, that combines horror and turn based strategy concepts. Players take control of evil, the hidden force pulling the strings in every horror movie that makes every creak, slams every door shut and draws its victims to their grisly ends. I hope to have a prototype developed by next October.

- *Concept:* Players have two objectives, draw the survivors in to release the monster from its dormant state and then take control of the monster in order to finish off the survivors. The game will feature several scenarios based on a familiar horror movie theme and an endless variety of randomly rolled factors, such as victim archetypes and traits, monster traits and weaknesses, and scenario objectives.

- *Code:* Implemented a third person camera system and selectable base character type.

## Brick Breakers and Phaser Prototype (Javascript/Phaser/HTML5)

### October 2015 to May 2016

### Game Description
Two simple projects I developed in order to learn Javascript and gain some mobile game development experience.

- *Technical:* Worked with a third-party framework in order to develop simple games. Published on Github in order to have friends test prototype on their various devices (mobile and desktop).

- *Design:* Tested concept of user flinging input that launched the character across screen. This seemed like a unique alternative to having a virtual d-pad that most 2D platformers on mobile use.

## Classic Game Clones (C++/SDL/Engine Development)

### Pre 2010

![SDL Games](/assets/img/SDLPreview.png)

### Game Description
At an early age, I taught myself C++ by developing classic game clones of _Pong_, _Tetris_ and _Pacman_. These games were foundational in teaching me Object-Oriented Programming, Game Design Patterns and how Game Engines worked at a very basic level. When I picked up game development again after a 5-year hiatus, I was pleasantly surprised to find that many of these concepts stuck with me.

- *Code:* Developed game engines from the ground up using SDL, and focusing on reuseable systems that could be used by future projects. Created a sprite resource management system, frame independent game/render loop, and an entity system that contained basic movement properties and collision detection.

- *Design:* Although these games were straight copies of their original counterparts, I prided myself on almost perfectly mimicking the AI behavior in _Ms Pacman_.

## Source Engine Modding (C++/Level Design & Scripting/Hammer Editor)

### Pre 2010

![Source Modding](/assets/img/SourcePreview.png)

### Game Description
My fascination with the immersive world of _Half-Life_ inspired me to develop content of my own. While many of the projects I worked on never saw a proper release, the experience laid the foundation for my love of game development, honed my development skills and gave me valuable working experience with others on creative projects.

- *Code:* Made minor tweaks to code that modified properties of weapons, enemies and game modes. Mostly this is where I gained a foundation in how a professional engine was developed and how all of the complex systems interact with each other.

- *Level Development:* Developed countless levels that focused on mood setting, level scripts that created complex world interaction and multiplayer map design.

- *Testing and Creative Collaboration:* Shared levels with other members of the _Interlopers_ mapping community and took constructive criticism.
