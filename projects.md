<div style="display:none;">_</div>

*Weapon System:*

Developed an easy to extend weapon system that fires projectiles, trace lines and timed melee attacks for players, AI and the environment.


*AI:*

Developed a base AI class with several behaviors (idling, charging, attacking, etc.) that could be reused by all of our enemy types. Integrated functionality into Blueprints and Behavior Trees so that designers could quickly prototype new enemy types with a library of behaviors.


*Leadership:*

Helped transition new and old team members from Unity to Unreal.

Managed a Perforce repository for a distributed team of in office and remote personnel.

Worked with artists to import assets into engine and get them running with Unreal's animation tools (Animation State Machine, Aim Offset, etc.)

Worked with designers on turning vision of game into functioning game mechanics.

<div style="display:none;">_</div>

### Game Description
One of my earlier projects. An almost one to one clone of the original _Pac-Man_. Researched how the AI behaved in the original arcade game and matched it almost exactly. Developed a resource management system with handles to resources that prevented multiple instances of a resource from being loaded. Every object in the game belonged to an Entity hierarchy that contained base properties and Update/Render overrideable functions. Render loop would update at a constant 60fps while the Update loop would update frame-independently of the render loop.


## Source Engine Modding

### Level Designer/Programmer (Source Engine - Hammer Editor - C++)
(2006 to 2010)

### Game Description
Developed numerous maps with a focus on building level geometry, setting atmospheric tone with lighting and effects, and creating scripted level events. Made minor code modifications to weapon, character and game mode classes. Worked collaboratively with other modders.
