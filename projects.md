### Game Description
A project me and a group of others developed for Ludum Dare /#39 with the theme "Running out of Power". Rather than taking this prompt literally and developing a game about battery power, our team collectively decided on a hero who would continually lose abilities over the course of the game. The combat was inspired by _Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery_ with a simple click the ability interface and timing based combat. AI runs on a simple interval based action state, with random rolling for Idle or Attack States. Players can attack, block, heal and quake (do massive damage) to enemies, but as mentioned above, they lose each of these abilities over the course of the game until they are left defenseless against their final foe.

Besides combat, the game is mostly focused on narrative and ambience. I can't give enough credit to my team for nailing the level design, art and audio for the project. I contributed to this aspect of the game by hooking up all these assets, timing the narration with various triggers in the game and making some minor modifications to the level in order to support the narrative.

Overall this was an incredibly experience and I am very proud that we were able to achieve where others traditionally fail and create a complete, narrative based experience with a unique combat system in only 72 hours.

## Horror RTS Game (Working Title/WIP)

### Game Description
A unique take on the RTS genre that mixes horror movie tropes, procedurally generated levels and ideas from the _The Sims_. Players take control of an unseen evil force luring unsuspecting AI into unleashing a sleeping monster. Inspired by _Betrayal on Haunted House Hill_ and _Cabin in the Woods_.


## Trivia Card Game (NDA)

### Self-Employed Web Developer/Designer (MongoDB - NODEjs - Javascript - Web Design)

A simple web-based trivia card game I am developing for a client using MongoDB and NODEjs for the backend and JQuery for the front end.


## Unity/Unreal Game Jam Projects

### Game Programmer (Unity - Unreal - C# - C++ - Blueprint Scripting)
(2016 to 2017)

### Games Description
Worked on several smaller games including:

*War of the Broses:* A two player bumper cart style battle game where players would battle each others armies. Made with Unity. Developed art assets and all of the code.

**AI Behavior Tree Sample:**

<div style="display:none;">_</div>

*Weapon Mechanics:*

Developed an easy to extend weapon system that fires projectiles, trace lines and timed melee attacks for players, AI and environment traps. Opened functionality up to scripting so that designers could easily prototype new weapon ideas.


*AI:*

Developed a base AI class with several behaviors (idling, charging, attacking, etc.) that could be reused by all of our enemy types. Integrated functionality into Blueprints and Behavior Trees so that designers could quickly prototype new enemy types with a library of behaviors.


*Teamwork:*

Helped transition new and old team members from Unity to Unreal.

Managed a Perforce repository for a distributed team of in office and remote personnel.

Worked with artists to import assets into engine and get them running with Unreal's animation tools (Animation State Machine, Aim Offset, etc.)

Worked with designers on turning vision of game into functioning game mechanics.

### Game Description
A simple breakout clone I developed over a short amount of time to learn Javascript and Phaser.

## Pac-Man Clone

### Programmer (SDL - C++)
(2006)

[![Pacman Clone Preview Image](/assets/img/PMPreview.PNG)](/assets/img/PMPreview.PNG){:target="_blank"}
<div style="display:none;">_</div>

### Game Description
One of my earlier projects. An almost one to one clone of the original _Pac-Man_. Researched how the AI behaved in the original arcade game and mimicked it closely. Developed a resource management system with handles to resources that prevented multiple instances of a resource from being loaded. Every object in the game belonged to an Entity hierarchy that contained base properties and Update/Render overrideable functions. Separated render and update loops from being locked to each other, ensuring that the game updated at a constant frame-rate and rendering would happen as fast as possible.


## Source Engine Modding

### Level Designer/Programmer (Source Engine - Hammer Editor - C++)
(2006 to 2010)

### Game Description
Developed numerous maps with a focus on building level geometry, setting atmospheric tone with lighting and effects, and creating scripted level events. Made minor code modifications to weapon, character and game mode classes. Worked collaboratively with other modders in the Interlopers community.
