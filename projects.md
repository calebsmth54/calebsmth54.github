### Game Description
A unique take on the RTS genre that mixes horror movie tropes, procedurally generated levels and ideas from the  _The Sims_. Players take control of an unseen evil force trying to lure unsuspecting AI into unleashing a sleeping monster. Inspired by _Betrayal on Haunted House Hill_ and _Cabin in the Woods_.

*Weapon Mechanics:*

Developed an easy to extend weapon system that fires projectiles, trace lines and timed melee attacks for players, AI and environment traps. Opened functionality up to scripting so that designers could easily prototype new weapon ideas.


*AI:*

Developed a base AI class with several behaviors (idling, charging, attacking, etc.) that could be reused by all of our enemy types. Integrated functionality into Blueprints and Behavior Trees so that designers could quickly prototype new enemy types with a library of behaviors.


*Teamwork:*

Helped transition new and old team members from Unity to Unreal.

Managed a Perforce repository for a distributed team of in office and remote personnel.

Worked with artists to import assets into engine and get them running with Unreal's animation tools (Animation State Machine, Aim Offset, etc.)

Worked with designers on turning vision of game into functioning game mechanics.

### Game Description
A simple breakout clone I developed over a short amount of time to learn Javascript and Phaser.

## Pac-Man Clone

### Programmer (SDL - C++)
(2006)

[![Pacman Clone Preview Image](/assets/img/PMPreview.PNG)](/assets/img/PMPreview.PNG){:target="_blank"}
<div style="display:none;">_</div>

### Game Description
One of my earlier projects. An almost one to one clone of the original _Pac-Man_. Researched how the AI behaved in the original arcade game and mimicked it closely. Developed a resource management system with handles to resources that prevented multiple instances of a resource from being loaded. Every object in the game belonged to an Entity hierarchy that contained base properties and Update/Render overrideable functions. Separated render and update loops from being locked to each other, ensuring that the game updated at a constant frame-rate and rendering would happen as fast as possible.


## Source Engine Modding

### Level Designer/Programmer (Source Engine - Hammer Editor - C++)
(2006 to 2010)

### Game Description
Developed numerous maps with a focus on building level geometry, setting atmospheric tone with lighting and effects, and creating scripted level events. Made minor code modifications to weapon, character and game mode classes. Worked collaboratively with other modders in the Interlopers community.
